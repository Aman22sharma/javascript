Found an inspiration, [Andreas Kling](https://github.com/awesomekling) on the web. He is building awesome stuff in open source community.

Tracing the paths of [Chris Ferdinandi](https://github.com/cferdinandi)'s blog, planning to write snippets of my achieved milestones here.

Brushed up my long ago Gatsby project lying around in my repositories, here I go.

Followed up on JS30 course and completed [Project 15](https://jolly-saha-1a28f1.netlify.com/), reading Eloquent JS one piece at a time, completed exercises from Chapter [1](https://brave-wright-a4e1e4.netlify.com/), [2](https://kind-stonebraker-dc7fc5.netlify.com/) and [3](https://vigorous-clarke-d7b379.netlify.com/).
